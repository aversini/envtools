## Description

**Envtools** is a command line helper for WF-RIA² framework developers.

Its primary goal is to simplify the tedious task of initializing a laptop for a framework developer. Many tools need to be installed, proxy and shell environments need to be configured. One mistake and hours are wasted trying to figure out what is wrong when a simple automation could have saved everybody's time.

Not only **Envtools** will setup a WF-RIA² developer environment in no time, it also comes loaded with goodies (bash aliases, fixes for the OS, Sublime and Atom plugins, etc.).

**IMPORTANT:** Xcode, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java</a> HAVE to be installed manually before hand.
