<h1>Commands</h1>
<h2>auto</h2>
<code>envtools auto</code>
<p>Use this command to bootstrap your environment automatically.</p>
<p>This command <em>should</em> rarely be used. Its goal is to set up and initialize a working environment for your terminal sessions. This is a step-by-step process (see the opposite option: manual) where all the available bootstrap options are being executed one after the other. It allows you to load useful aliases, set your proxy, setup your git and npm configurations, ect.</p>

<h2>manual</h2>
<code>envtools manual</code>
<p>Use this command to bootstrap your environment manually.</p>
<p>This command allows you to choose which step to run manually. It offers the same steps that are being executed with <code>envtools auto</code>, but with the flexibility to choose which one you need. It is most useful for an environment that has been bootstrapped before, but needs to be reconfigured one way or another after a while (fix user permissions, re-install core node packages, new version of envtools, etc.)</p>

<h2>extra</h2>
<code>envtools extra</code>
<p>Install and configure some extra goodies that are not included in the manual/automatic bootstrap routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Configure npm to use <code>Sinopia</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Install some <code>Atom</code> core packages.
  </li>
  <li class="mac-only">
    Install and configure Node Version Manager (<code>nvm</code>) which is a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions. Please see <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown">nvm readme</a> for more information.
  </li>
  <li class="mac-only">
    Install a <code>Custom Terminal Theme</code>. It was built to use more subtle colors that are better suited when using a dark terminal. The background is black.
  </li>
  <li class="mac-only">
    Install some <code>QuickLook Plugins</code>. For example in the Finder, pressing on the SPACE bar when selecting a .zip or .pkg file would open a tree preview of the content of the packages... You need this.
  </li>
  <li class="mac-only">
    Fix Mac screensaver files permissions. If you are changing your screensaver settings and realize that after a while, they are reset to the previous values, you need this fix.
  </li>
  <li>
    More goodies are added regularly...
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>web</h2>
<code>envtools web</code>
<p>
  Start a simple static web server that will serve the current folder. Use <code>--port [port-num]</code> to specify a different port than 8080.
</p>

<h2>lite</h2>
<code>envtools lite</code>
<p>
  This command will create a compressed file under the current folder.
</p>
<p>
  It contains a very limited subset of Envtools, the bare minimum to at least have a decent prompt, as well as a few core aliases (ll, etc.). It does not have any of Envtools node capabilities since the package only contains shell scripts helpers. It is usefull if you need to work in a remote server that does not have node/npm but can execute bash scripts.
</p>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Copy the generated tar.gz file on the destination machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>$ scp envlite-x.x.xxx.tgz remoteServerName:</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Login to the remote machine and untar the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>$ ssh remoteServerName</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>$ tar xf envlite-x.x.xxx.tgz</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Add the following lines to your profile (.bashrc or .bash_profile)
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>ENVTOOLS_LITE=1 && source "$HOME/envlite/load.sh"</code>
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That's it! Just reload your environment and you should have a better prompt already.
