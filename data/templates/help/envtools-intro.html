<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><strong>Envtools</strong> is a command line helper for software developers.</p>

<p>Its primary goal is to simplify the tedious task of initializing a laptop/desktop for a developer. Many tools need to be installed, proxy and shell environments need to be configured. One mistake and hours are wasted trying to figure out what is wrong when a simple automation could have saved everybody's time.</p>

<p>Not only <strong>Envtools</strong> will setup a developer's environment in no time, it also comes loaded with goodies (bash aliases, git prompt and completion, <span class="mac-only"> fixes for the OS, nvm installer, </span>Atom Plugins, etc.) as well as unique commands like a simple web server, a file encryptor, etc.</p>
