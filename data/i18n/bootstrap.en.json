Its goal is to set up and initialize a working clone of your WF-RIA² fork from Gitlab into your local machine.\n\nOnce this step is done, you can switch branches, create branches, publish to Gitlab, create Merge Requests, etc. You may want to run the command again to start from scratch in the future.\n\nThis command is interactive: it will ask for the following parameters:\n\n - Where do you want to clone locally.\n\n - Your git user name. This is your Gitlab fork name.\n\nOnce the command is done, a new folder named 'wria2git' by default (but you may have named it differently) will be created and is ready for you to work on.",
